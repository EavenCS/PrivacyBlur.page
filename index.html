        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 23.02.2026</p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Privacy Blur (“the App”) handles
          information. Privacy Blur is a macOS status bar application that
          temporarily blurs screens to support focused work. The App runs
          entirely locally on your device, does not require an account, and does
          not transmit personal data to us or third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No personal data collection.</li>
          <li>No analytics, advertising, or tracking technologies.</li>
          <li>All settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
          <li>Email processing occurs only if you voluntarily contact us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Controller</h3>
        <p>
          Eaven-René Schmalz<br />
          Email: schmalze@gmail.com<br />
          [Optional: Postal address if required by law]
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information Processed Locally</h3>
        <p>The App stores only local preferences such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Selected keyboard shortcut</li>
          <li>Blur behavior settings</li>
          <li>Optional mouse input blocking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All such data remains exclusively on your device. We do not access,
          collect, transmit, or store this information externally.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information You Provide via Email</h3>
        <p>If you contact us, we may process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your email address</li>
          <li>The content of your message</li>
          <li>Any attachments you voluntarily provide</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry.</p>

        <h3>Legal Basis (GDPR)</h3>
        <p>
          Where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies, email
          communications are processed based on legitimate interests (Art.
          6(1)(f) GDPR) or to take steps at your request prior to entering into
          a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).
        </p>

        <h3>Data Retention</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Local app preferences remain until you delete the App.</li>
          <li>Email correspondence is retained only as long as necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Rights</h3>
        <p>
          If GDPR applies, you have the right to access, rectify, erase,
          restrict processing, object to processing, and lodge a complaint with
          a supervisory authority.
        </p>

        <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          The App is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect
          personal data from children.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          The App uses standard macOS storage mechanisms (UserDefaults). No user
          data is transmitted externally.
        </p>

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          Use of the App is at your own risk. We are not liable for damages,
          data loss, or disadvantages arising from software errors (bugs),
          technical issues, or improper use of the App.

        <p>
          These Terms of Service govern your use of Privacy Blur (“the App”).
          The App is offered as a one-time purchase through the Apple App Store.

          Apple’s App Store Terms and Apple Media Services Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          You receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
          license to use the App on Apple-branded devices that you own or
          control.
        </p>

        <h3>2. No Ongoing Maintenance Obligation</h3>
        <p>
          The App is provided as a standalone software product. We are not
          obligated to provide maintenance, updates, upgrades, feature
          enhancements, or continued development.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, discontinue, or permanently remove the App or
          any feature at any time and without providing a reason.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Availability</h3>
        <p>
          We do not guarantee that the App will remain available on the Apple
          App Store.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          All payments are processed by Apple. Refund requests must be submitted
          directly to Apple and are handled according to Apple’s refund
          policies. We do not process payments and cannot issue refunds
          independently.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
        <p>
          The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of
          any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a
          particular purpose, or non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be
          liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
          damages, including loss of data, profits, or business interruption.
        </p>

        <h3>7. User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          You agree not to misuse, reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to
          disrupt the App except as permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Changes to These Terms</h3>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App
          constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the developer’s country of
          residence, excluding conflict of law principles.
